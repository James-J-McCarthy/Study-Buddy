# Study-Buddy
## Developed by: James McCarthy, Elisa Avalos, Sam Robertson, Yunzhu (Jessica) Chen

Welcome to Study Buddy! A virtual buddy who helps you study efficiently by implementing the Pomodoro Technique without the harshness of your typical timer.

## Installation
To run the program: download .exe, .pck, and .DS_Store files compatible with your operating system, and open the .exe file to start studying with Buddy. The Mac version sometimes requires a user to select "open anyway" in the system's privacy settings.

## Development
Install the Godot Engine (4.2.2): https://godotengine.org/download/windows/

All source code was written in GDScript.

## Bugs 
1. Slider grippers in the settings donâ€™t return to the neutral state until a different slider is selected

2. The asset for the phone's home button sometimes does not load

3. The one cycle session sometimes becomes one cycle and one additional studying block before the end of session screen and chime plays (inconsistent behavior across operating systems)

4. The audio becomes unsynced with the correct block (study or break) if the session settings are reset while the audio is still fading


## Acknowledgements
Our app would fail to be what it is without these very useful audios we found on the internet:
